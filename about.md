Hey, I'm Eric Orellana, a software developer. I live here in New York City. I enjoy visiting new places like the [HighLine](http://www.thehighline.org/about), which is breathtaking and I recommend you to go. On my freetime, I enjoy reading books. Some of my favorites are ['The Personal MBA'](http://www.amazon.com/The-Personal-MBA-Master-Business/dp/1591845572) by Josh Kaufman, ['Mindset - The New Psychology of Success'](http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-The-New-Psychology-Success/dp/0345472322) by Carol S. Dweck, and ['The Alchemist'](http://www.amazon.com/The-Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416) by Paulo Coelho. I see books as golden treasure in today's society. I can download someone else's knowledge, that took them years to figure out, right into my brain for a very low cost, now that's a ridiculous, insane bargain!

### How did I start coding?
I started coding while I was in college, studying Finance. I enjoyed the freedom and creative process of coding. The only limitation was my imagination. I decided to find others who were also passionate and wanted to learn together. That's when I heard about the [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/) Web Development program. I got accepted and I can't thank my peers and instructors enough for all of their support while helping me start this amazing career.

### What do I love about coding?
I love how coding is a mirror expression of my own thoughts. I get to see my thoughts expressed on my text editor and then I can read it, edit it, submit it for a code review, it's just amazing! I love how I get to be a detective when I have a bug in my program. I love the character traits that it has helped me develop like patience, humility, and courage. I love how there's always something to new learn, whether it is from my colleague, or an article I encounter. I love the mind-bending training I go through while coding, and how it satisfies my passion for learning and solving challenging problems.
