Hi, I'm <strong> Eric Orellana </strong>, a software developer, living in New York City. I enjoy visiting new places like the [HighLine](http://www.thehighline.org/about), which is breathtaking and I recommend you to go. On my freetime, I enjoy reading books. Some of my favorites are ['The Personal MBA'](http://www.amazon.com/The-Personal-MBA-Master-Business/dp/1591845572) by Josh Kaufman, ['Mindset - The New Psychology of Success'](http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-The-New-Psychology-Success/dp/0345472322) by Carol S. Dweck, and ['The Alchemist'](http://www.amazon.com/The-Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416) by Paulo Coelho. I see books as golden treasure in today's society. I can download someone else's knowledge, that took them years to figure out, right into my brain for a very low cost, now that's a ridiculous, insane bargain!

### How did I start coding?
I had this inner feeling that kept me up at night. I felt like I was not on the right path. After experimenting with investing in stocks, learning how to license ideas, and delving through finance books, I didn't feel quite satisfied. I felt the need to create something from its very essence, to bring my ideas to life. I turned to technology and explored the world of coding. After college, I would come home and complete objectives on 'Codeacademy' and 'Treehouse.' I felt inspired and determined to continue no matter how difficult it seemed. I wanted to find a community of passionate coders, whom I can learn with, so I applied to the [Flatiron School Web Development Fellowship](http://flatironschool.com/nycworkforce1/). I got accepted, met brilliant people, and was surrounded by code from nine in the morning to six in the evening, you bet I learned. There were many struggles along the way, but I never gave up on myself. My peers and instructors were of great support and I canâ€™t thank them enough.

### What do I love about coding?
I love how coding is a mirror expression of my own thoughts. I love how I get to play detective when I have a bug in my program. I love the character traits that it has helped me develop like patience, humility, and courage. I love how there's always something to new learn, whether it is from my colleague, or an article I encounter. I love the mind-bending training I go through while coding, and how it satisfies my passion for learning and solving challenging problems. I love the collaborative process of coding, and reading everyone's unique solution to a problem. As a whole, we grow exponentially, because each of us has new information that we can share and add to our mental models. I love how coding unites us.
